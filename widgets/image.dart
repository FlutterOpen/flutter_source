  /// A package can also choose to have assets in its 'lib/' folder that are not

  ///
  /// ```
  /// lib/backgrounds/background1.png
  /// lib/backgrounds/background2.png
  /// lib/backgrounds/background3.png
  /// ```

  /// To include, say the first image, the `pubspec.yaml` of the app should

  /// is still loading.
  ///
  /// If this is null, and the image is loaded incrementally (e.g. over a
  /// network), the user will receive no indication of the progress as the
  /// bytes of the image are loaded.
  ///
  /// For more information on how to interpret the arguments that are passed to
  /// this builder, see the documentation on [ImageLoadingBuilder].
  ///
  /// ## Performance implications
  ///
  /// If a [loadingBuilder] is specified for an image, the [Image] widget is
  /// likely to be rebuilt on every
  /// [rendering pipeline frame](rendering/RendererBinding/drawFrame.html) until
  /// the image has loaded. This is useful for cases such as displaying a loading
  /// progress indicator, but for simpler cases such as displaying a placeholder
  /// widget that doesn't depend on the loading progress (e.g. static "loading"
  /// text), [frameBuilder] will likely work and not incur as much cost.
  ///
  /// ## Chaining with [frameBuilder]
  ///
  /// If a [frameBuilder] has _also_ been specified for an image, the two
  /// builders will be chained together: the `child` argument to this
  /// builder will contain the _result_ of the [frameBuilder]. For example,
  /// consider the following builders used in conjunction:
  ///
  /// {@macro flutter.widgets.image.chainedBuildersExample}
  ///
  /// {@tool sample --template=stateless_widget_material}
  ///
  /// The following sample uses [loadingBuilder] to show a
  /// [CircularProgressIndicator] while an image loads over the network.
  ///
  /// ```dart
  /// Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  ///   return DecoratedBox(
  ///     decoration: BoxDecoration(
  ///       color: Colors.white,
  ///       border: Border.all(),
  ///       borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(20),
  ///     ),
  ///     child: Image.network(
  ///       'https://example.com/image.jpg',
  ///       loadingBuilder: (BuildContext context, Widget child, ImageChunkEvent loadingProgress) {
  ///         if (loadingProgress == null)
  ///           return child;
  ///         return Center(
  ///           child: CircularProgressIndicator(
  ///             value: loadingProgress.expectedTotalBytes != null
  ///                 ? loadingProgress.cumulativeBytesLoaded / loadingProgress.expectedTotalBytes
  ///                 : null,

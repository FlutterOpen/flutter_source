/// A widget that manages a [FocusNode] to allow keyboard focus to be given
/// to this widget and its descendants.
///
/// When the focus is gained or lost, [onFocusChanged] is called.
///
/// For keyboard events, [onKey] is called if [FocusNode.hasFocus] is true for
/// this widget's [focusNode], unless a focused descendant's [onKey] callback
/// returns false when called.
///
/// This widget does not provide any visual indication that the focus has
/// changed. Any desired visual changes should be made when [onFocusChanged] is
/// called.
///
/// To access the [FocusNode] of the nearest ancestor [Focus] widget and
/// establish a relationship that will rebuild the widget when the focus
/// changes, use the [Focus.of] and [FocusScope.of] static methods.
///
/// To access the focused state of the nearest [Focus] widget, use
/// [Focus.hasFocus] from a build method, which also establishes a relationship
/// between the calling widget and the [Focus] widget that will rebuild the
/// calling widget when the focus changes.
///
/// Managing a [FocusNode] means managing its lifecycle, listening for changes
/// in focus, and re-parenting it when needed to keep the focus hierarchy in
/// sync with the widget hierarchy. See [FocusNode] for more information about
/// the details of what node management entails if not using a [Focus] widget.
///
/// To collect a sub-tree of nodes into a group, use a [FocusScope].

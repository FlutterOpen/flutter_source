/// _Please see the [Focus] and [FocusScope] widgets, which are utility widgets
/// that manage their own [FocusNode]s and [FocusScopeNode]s, respectively. If
/// they aren't appropriate, [FocusNode]s can be managed directly._
///
/// [FocusNode]s are persistent objects that form a _focus tree_ that is a
/// representation of the widgets in the hierarchy that are interested in focus.
/// A focus node might need to be created if it is passed in from an ancestor of
/// a [Focus] widget to control the focus of the children from the ancestor, or
/// a widget might need to host one if the widget subsystem is not being used,
/// or if the [Focus] and [FocusScope] widgets provide insufficient control.
///
/// [FocusNodes] are organized into _scopes_ (see [FocusScopeNode]), which form
/// sub-trees of nodes that can be traversed as a group. Within a scope, the
/// most recent nodes to have focus are remembered, and if a node is focused and
/// then removed, the previous node receives focus again.
///
/// The focus node hierarchy can be traversed using the [parent], [children],
/// [ancestors] and [descendants] accessors.
///
/// [FocusNode]s are [ChangeNotifier]s, so a listener can be registered to
/// receive a notification when the focus changes. If the [Focus] and
/// [FocusScope] widgets are being used to manage the nodes, consider
/// establishing an [InheritedWidget] dependency on them by calling [Focus.of]
/// or [FocusScope.of] instead. [Focus.hasFocus] can also be used to establish a
/// similar dependency, especially if all that is needed is to determine whether
/// or not the widget is focused at build time.
///
/// To see the focus tree in the debug console, call [debugDumpFocusTree]. To
/// get the focus tree as a string, call [debugDescribeFocusTree].
///
/// {@template flutter.widgets.focus_manager.focus.lifecycle}
/// ## Lifecycle
///
/// There are several actors involved in the lifecycle of a
/// [FocusNode]/[FocusScopeNode]. They are created and disposed by their
/// _owner_, attached, detached, and re-parented using a [FocusAttachment] by
/// their _host_ (which must be owned by the [State] of a [StatefulWidget]), and
/// they are managed by the [FocusManager]. Different parts of the [FocusNode]
/// API are intended for these different actors.
///
/// [FocusNode]s (and hence [FocusScopeNode]s) are persistent objects that form
/// part of a _focus tree_ that is a sparse representation of the widgets in the
/// hierarchy that are interested in receiving keyboard events. They must be
/// managed like other persistent state, which is typically done by a
/// [StatefulWidget] that owns the node. A stateful widget that owns a focus
/// scope node must call [dispose] from its [State.dispose] method.
///
/// Once created, a [FocusNode] must be attached to the widget tree via a
/// [FocusAttachment] object. This attachment is created by calling [attach],
/// usually from the [State.initState] method. If the hosting widget is updated
/// to have a different focus node, then the updated node needs to be attached
/// in [State.didUpdateWidget], after calling [detach] on the previous
/// [FocusAttachment].
///
/// Because [FocusNode]s form a sparse representation of the widget tree,
/// they must be updated whenever the widget tree is rebuilt. This is done by
/// calling [FocusAttachment.reparent], usually from the [State.build] or
/// [State.didChangeDependencies] methods of the widget that represents the
/// focused region, so that the [BuildContext] assigned to the [FocusScopeNode]
/// can be tracked (the context is used to obtain the [RenderObject], from which
/// the geometry of focused regions can be determined).
///
/// Creating a [FocusNode] each time [State.build] is invoked will cause the
/// focus to be lost each time the widget is built, which is usually not desired
/// behavior (call [unfocus] if losing focus is desired).
///
/// If, as is common, the hosting [StatefulWidget] is also the owner of the
/// focus node, then it will also call [dispose] from its [State.dispose] (in
/// which case the [detach] may be skipped, since dispose will automatically
/// detach). If another object owns the focus node, then it must call [dispose]
/// when the node is done being used.
/// {@endtemplate}
///
/// {@template flutter.widgets.focus_manager.focus.keyEvents}
/// ## Key Event Propagation
///
/// The [FocusManager] receives all key events and will pass them to the focused
/// nodes. It starts with the node with the primary focus, and will call the
/// [onKey] callback for that node. If the callback returns false, indicating
/// that it did not handle the event, the [FocusManager] will move to the parent
/// of that node and call its [onKey]. If that [onKey] returns true, then it
/// will stop propagating the event. If it reaches the root [FocusScopeNode],
/// [FocusManager.rootScope], the event is discarded.
/// {@endtemplate}
///
/// ## Focus Traversal
///
/// The term _traversal_, sometimes called _tab traversal_, refers to moving the
/// focus from one widget to the next in a particular order (also sometimes
/// referred to as the _tab order_, since the TAB key is often bound to the
/// action to move to the next widget).
///
/// To give focus to the logical _next_ or _previous_ widget in the UI, call the
/// [nextFocus] or [previousFocus] methods. To give the focus to a widget in a
/// particular direction, call the [focusInDirection] method.
///
/// The policy for what the _next_ or _previous_ widget is, or the widget in a
/// particular direction, is determined by the [FocusTraversalPolicy] in force.
///
/// The ambient policy is determined by looking up the widget hierarchy for a
/// [DefaultFocusTraversal] widget, and obtaining the focus traversal policy
/// from it. Different focus nodes can inherit difference policies, so part of
/// the app can go in widget order, and part can go in reading order, depending
/// upon the use case.
///
/// Predefined policies include [WidgetOrderFocusTraversalPolicy],
/// [ReadingOrderTraversalPolicy], and [DirectionalFocusTraversalPolicyMixin],
/// but custom policies can be built based upon these policies.
///
/// {@tool sample --template=stateless_widget_scaffold}
/// This example shows how a FocusNode should be managed if not using the
/// [Focus] or [FocusScope] widgets. See the [Focus] widget for a similar
/// example using [Focus] and [FocusScope] widgets.
